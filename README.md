# DNDA Final Project  
This project visualises a speculative future trend: the increasing adoption of AI-augmented design tools from 2020 to 2050.

## Why this matters  
The course teaches cultural analysis and futures thinking. This project demonstrates:
- Identifying a cultural trend (AI + design)
- Forecasting its future growth
- Visualising the future scenario using Plotly.js

## Files  
- index.html — main website
- style.css — styling
